                                        #1 – Helmet Age
                                        How old is your helmet? Like I mentioned at the beginning of this article, if
                                        you have worn your helmet for over 5 years, then it might be time to replace it.

                                        But why should you replace your helmet every 5 years? After 5 years of
                                        consistent wear and tear, your helmet will have more than likely weakened. I
                                        know it may look like it is in perfect condition but you should consider its age
                                        and the impact it has on the components of the helmet.

                                        If you wear your helmet consistently, it becomes exposed to weather, dirt, UV
                                        rays, and other elements that you may not think about having an effect on the
                                        integrity of your helmet. These elements ultimately weaken the resins and glues
                                        that hold it together.

                                        Although there is no definitive research on this, the 5 year age expiration date
                                        is enforced by most manufacturers. There are other factors that can play into
                                        the lifespan of your helmet. So even though 5 years is the recommended age limit
                                        for a replacement, it could be a few years less or more.

                                        The average Shoei helmet lifespan is around 5 years. You can use that as a
                                        reference point since they are one of the most reputable brands in the industry.
                                        Also, Snell safety standards enforce a 5-year policy. Therefore manufacturers
                                        make sure to abide by this to prevent potential lawsuits.

                                        #2 – Usage
                                        If you wear your helmet every day, it becomes exposed to constant wear and tear.
                                        It may not be entirely apparent but consistent use weakens the integrity of your
                                        helmet over time.

                                        You can compare it to riding your bike or driving your car every day. As the
                                        miles stack up, you need to either perform more maintenance or purchase a new
                                        one.

                                        #3 – Have You Been In An Accident?
                                        This should be completely obvious but this fact needs to be mentioned. If you
                                        have experienced an accident then it may be time for a new helmet. You need to
                                        thoroughly check your helmet and possibly get it x-rayed for any damage.

                                        Wearing a broken helmet will not serve you any protection. I can’t stress this
                                        enough. Do not wear a helmet that has been in an accident. It is simply not
                                        worth your life to save a few dollars.

                                        #4 – Helmet Becomes Loose
                                        When you buy a new helmet it fits very snug. If you turn or shake your head it
                                        remains stuck to your noggin like glue.

                                        To determine if your helmet has loosened try this test. Shake your head
                                        side-to-side. Does it remain stuck to your head or does it slide around? If your
                                        helmet slides around while shaking your head, this means your padding has become
                                        compacted and may be time for a replacement. You can also check for indentations
                                        in the foam lining.

                                        Your helmet should hug your head firmly. You do not want to be in an accident
                                        wearing a loose helmet. Traumatic brain injury has been linked to loose-fitting
                                        helmets so make sure yours fits tightly or get a new one.

                                        #5 – Interior Starts Deteriorating
                                        Usually, it is not the outside shell that deteriorates first. It is typically
                                        the lining and foam inside of the helmet. If the inside of your helmet starts to
                                        flake off into your hair or onto your shoulders, that is a good sign you need a
                                        helmet replacement.

                                        Whether this happens after 3 years of use or 5, I would seriously consider
                                        purchasing a new helmet. Since the EPS liner is usually painted black, you can
                                        also check for tiny white cracks forming inside of your helmet.

                                        If this happens that means the integrity of the helmet is weakening and will not
                                        be able to absorb impact effectively. Be mindful if you use hair product as that
                                        can assist in deteriorating the insides of your helmet.

                                        #6 – Exterior Start Deteriorating
                                        If the shell of your helmet becomes brittle, has cracks, or begins to fall apart
                                        then you need to replace your helmet. I’m hoping this is obvious but just want
                                        to make sure that wearing a helmet in this weakened condition is not safe.

                                        The shell is the first point of contact during an accident. Therefore this part
                                        should be very strong and durable. Any cracks in the shell will instantly expose
                                        your head to injury if you are in an accident.

                                        #7 – Strap or Lock Failure
                                        Have the straps stopped working properly on your helmet? For those of you who
                                        wear your helmets often you may notice that your strap locks have become
                                        corroded due to weather and dirt.

                                        Your helmet chin strap is a critical component to keeping your helmet on your
                                        head. If this part does not work properly then it might be time to buy a new
                                        helmet or find a chin strap replacement

                                    <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default,
                                    until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each
                                    element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and
                                    hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding
                                    our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within
                                    the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
